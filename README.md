# Coffee Shop Full Stack

![coffee-shop](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/833824/82158436-d0be5c80-9855-11ea-9122-8ec4d8436aa5.jpg)
---------------------
Udacity has decided to open a new digitally enabled cafe for students to order drinks, socialize, and study hard. 

The full stack drink menu application must:

1) Display graphics representing the ratios of ingredients in each drink.
2) Allow public users to view drink names and graphics.
3) Allow the shop baristas to see the recipe information.
4) Allow the shop managers to create new drinks and edit existing drinks.

## Tasks

There are `@TODO` comments throughout project. We recommend tackling the sections in order. Start by reading the READMEs in:

1. [`./backend/`](./backend/README.md)
2. [`./frontend/`](./frontend/README.md)

## About the Stack

### Backend

The `./backend` directory contains a partially completed Flask server with a pre-written SQLAlchemy module to simplify your data needs. You will need to complete the required endpoints, configure, and integrate Auth0 for authentication.

[View the README.md within ./backend for more details.](./backend/README.md)

### Frontend

The `./frontend` directory contains a complete Ionic frontend to consume the data from the Flask server. You will only need to update the environment variables found within (./frontend/src/environment/environment.ts) to reflect the Auth0 configuration details set up for the backend app. 

[View the README.md within ./frontend for more details.](./frontend/README.md)
